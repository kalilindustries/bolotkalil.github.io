**Agym** is an eco-friendly, high-capacity power system designed to provide reliable electricity in remote areas or during outages.  
It combines **solar, water, and wind charging capabilities** in one powerful unit, making it an ideal choice for off-grid living, rural communities, and mobile setups.

As the **creator and lead engineer**, I developed Agym entirely in-house — from enclosure design to electronic systems — ensuring maximum efficiency, durability, and adaptability for different environments.
