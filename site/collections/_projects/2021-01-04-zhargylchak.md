**Zhargylchak** is a powerful, industrial-grade hay shredder designed to help farmers maximize feed efficiency and reduce waste.  
It was created in response to the needs of farmers across Kyrgyz Republic, where unshredded hay often gets trampled or soiled, leading to significant losses.

As the **creator and lead engineer**, I developed Zhargylchak from the ground up — from mechanical design and material selection to production and quality control — ensuring high performance and long service life.
