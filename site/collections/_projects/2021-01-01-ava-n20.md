# AVA — Next-Generation Intelligent Auto-Tracking Camera System

**AVA** is an advanced, AI-powered camera system that automatically tracks subjects in real time — no camera operator required.  
As the **Lead Engineer** on this project, I designed and implemented the entire technical solution: from the **embedded firmware** and **motion control algorithms** to the **Flutter-based mobile application** that manages the system.

AVA has gained international recognition — it was featured on **[BBC Click](https://youtu.be/jGB8lTrgKzA?si=SCyUOAAUxk7BeDiO&t=116)** as an innovation in smart filming technology, and won the **Theo Paphitis' Small Business Sunday (SBS)** award, earning direct recognition from the renowned British entrepreneur and investor.

## Key Capabilities of AVA
- **Smart subject tracking:** Seamlessly follows a person, object, or scene in real time.
- **Multiple tracking modes:** Smooth following, subject-centering, or dynamic framing.
- **Mobile app integration:** The AVA App provides live preview, target selection, and precise control over tracking settings.
- **Effortless setup:** Mount the camera, pair it with the app, and start filming within minutes.

## Common Use Cases
- **Sports & training:** Capture athletes in action without a cameraman.
- **Content creation:** Perfect for vloggers, streamers, and solo presenters.
- **Events & lectures:** Automatically keeps speakers or stage activities in frame.
