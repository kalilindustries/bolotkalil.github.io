# ShotPage — Intelligent Sports Video Analysis Platform

**ShotPage** is an app and web-based platform designed for **tennis players, golfers**, and more sports in the future.  
It processes raw gameplay videos into **standardized “Shot Clips”** for detailed analysis by coaches — and, in the future, by AI.

## How It Works
1. **Upload Raw Video** — Record yourself performing shots during training or matches.
2. **Automatic Shot Detection** — ShotPage detects the **contact point** for each shot.
3. **Standardized Clips** — Each “Shot Clip” is exactly 3 seconds long:
    - 1.5 seconds before the contact point
    - 1.5 seconds after the contact point
4. **Key Moment Stills** — Along with the video, **21 still images** are generated:
    - 10 frames before contact
    - The exact contact frame
    - 10 frames after contact  
      All perfectly timed to capture the most important moments.

## Phase 1 — Coach-Assisted Analysis
In the initial release, players will be able to share their **Shot Clips** with coaches, who can provide professional tips and advice on improving technique.

## Phase 2 — AI Coaching
As ShotPage grows its dataset of analyzed shots, we will:
- **Curate the dataset** with the help of professional coaches.
- **Annotate each shot** with expert tips and corrective feedback.
- **Train an AI model** capable of analyzing shots and suggesting technique improvements automatically.  
  This will turn ShotPage into your personal **AI Coach**, available anytime.

## Use Cases
- **Tennis training** — Review form, footwork, and timing.
- **Golf swing analysis** — Break down each part of your swing.
- **Remote coaching** — Send clips to your coach from anywhere.
- **AI-assisted improvement** — Get instant, data-driven feedback.

## Technologies Involved
- Computer vision for contact point detection
- Automated video editing
- Frame extraction and annotation
- Machine learning for AI coaching
